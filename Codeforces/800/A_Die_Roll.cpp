/*
//  A. Die Roll


### Steps to Solve:

* Identify the highest roll between Yakko and Wakko:
   * Find the maximum value between Y & W.

* Calculate Dot's winning outcomes
   * Dot wins if she rolls any number equal to or higher than this maximum value.

* Determine the number of winning outcomes for Dot:
   * If the highest roll between Yakko and Wakko is 3, Dot wins if she rolls a 3, 4, 5, or 6. That's 4 possible winning outcomes.
   * If the highest roll is 5, Dot wins if she rolls a 5 or 6. That's 2 possible winning outcomes.
   
* Total possible outcomes:
   * Since Dot rolls a six-sided die, there are always 6 possible outcomes (1 through 6).

* Calculate the probability:
   * The probability of Dot winning is the number of winning outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   * This fraction is then simplified to its irreducible form.

* Example: 
    Suppose Y=4 and W=2:
        max_roll = max‚Å°(4,2)=4
        Dot needs to roll 4, 5, or 6.
        Number of successful outcomes: 6 - 4 + 1 = 3
        Total possible outcomes: 6
        Probability: 3/6 = 1/2
