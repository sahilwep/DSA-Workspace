// Longest common subsequence Introduction:

    // Subsequence: 
        * A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements, 
        * without changing the order of the remaining elements.
        * The characters do not need to be contiguous but must appear in the same order.
        * Example:
            For the string "abcde", the subsequences include "ace", "bde", and "abcde", 
            but not "aec" because it does not follow the original order.

    // Substring:
        * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
        * All characters of the substring must appear consecutively in the original string.
        * Example:
            For the string "abcde", the substrings include "a", "abc", "cde", 
            but not "ace" because the characters are not consecutive.


    // Subsets:
        * A subset refers to a set of elements that can be formed from the elements of another set.
        * In the case of strings, a subset can refer to the set of individual characters of the string, regardless of their order or position.
        * Example:
            For the string "abc", subsets of characters include {}, {"a"}, {"b", "c"}, {"a", "b", "c"}, etc. 
            The order does not matter, and characters are treated as individual elements.


    * We will exploring various question based on this LCS Particular Types:


// Question Variations:
    1. Longest Common subsequence
    2. Print LCS.
    3. Shortest Common Super-sequence
    4. Print SCS
    5. Minimum number of insertion & deletions
    6. Longest Repeating Subsequence
    7. Length of Longest Subsequence of "a" which is a substring in 'b'
    8. Subsequence Pattern matching
    9. Count how many times "a" appears as a subsequence in "b".
    10. Longest Palindromic Subsequence.
    11. Longest Palindromic Substring.
    12. Count of the Palindromic Substring.
    13. Minimum number of deletion in a string to make it a Palindrome.
    14. Minimum number of insertion in a string to make it a Palindrome.
