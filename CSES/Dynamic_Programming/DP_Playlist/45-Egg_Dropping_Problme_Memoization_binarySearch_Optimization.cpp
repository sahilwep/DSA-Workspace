//  Egg Dropping Problem Memoization binary Search Optimizations:


//  Problem Statement:
    * We are given N identical eggs, and we have access to K-floored building from 1 to K.
    * There exist a floor 'f' where 0 <= f <= k, such that any egg dropped from a floor higher than 'f' will break, 
    * and any egg dropped from or below floor f will not break.
        * An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
        * A broken egg must be discarded.
        * The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
        * If the egg doesn't break at a certain floor, it will not break at any floor below.
        * If the egg break at a certain floor, it will break at any floor above.
        
    * Return the minimum number of moves you need to determine with certainly what the value of 'f' is.



// Visualization: 

        * We are given N eggs & K floors, & From these we need find minimum number of attempts to find the floor, which will (critical floor/ Threshold floor).

        // Worse case Evaluations:

                * If we are given only one egg, we need to use it very wisely. Dropping it from a random floor risks breaking the egg, and if it breaks, we wonâ€™t be able to determine the "critical floor."
                * In the worst case, with only one egg, we would drop it starting from the first floor, then the second, then the third, and so on, until we find the "critical floor."
                * If the egg does not break, we can continue using it to test the next floors. This way, we will eventually identify the "critical floor."
                * Therefore, if we have only one egg, we would drop it sequentially from the 1st floor up to the 'f' floor to find the critical threshold.

                        1 egg => F attempts needed
        

                * So, we can say we have to find:
                    * In Worse case, by using best technique & minimize the number of attempts, we have to find the "Critical floor".
                    * & We have to return the number of attempts.

                    FOR, BOTH DECISIONS WE ARE TAKING FROM WORSE CASE: According to the question, we need to find minimum number of attempts in worse case:
                    Because we are finding these decision from worse case: this is why we will take max() from both the decisions.

                        tempAns = max(Breaks, Not-Breaks)

                    WE HAVE ONLY COMPUTED FOR (EGGS & FLOORS), WE HAVEN't COMPUTED FOR ATTEMPTS 
                        
                        tempAns = max(solve(e-1, k-1), solve(e, f-k))

                        So for every attempts, we will add 1 to both the decisions.

            // find answer from temporary answer:

                At last we need minimum number of attempts, from above the temporary answer:

                    ans = min(ans, tempAns)



// Recursive Complexity:
    * TC: O(2^f)
    * AS: O(f)  -> f calls in recursive stack.


// Problem with Recursive Solution: 
    * From given recursive solution, we will have subproblem, called & Computes multiple times.
    * TC: O(2^n)


// Intrusion: 
    * Solution for that we will use DP solution: 
        * We will use memoization solution
        * We will have to maintain memo table of variable size (changing size parameters): (e & f)
        * Create a 2D table of size (ExF)
    * Whenever recursive function calls for solution of subproblem, we will apply check that if the value exist, return directly from memo table without going into the recursive calls.
    * If solution is not exist in table, compute the solution, & store result in table & then return the values.



// Memoization Complexity:
    * TC: O(e*f^2)
    * AS: O(f)



// Optimized Using Binary Search:
    * We can implement a binary Search on the k-partition instead of a linear search.
    * This is based on the observation that, as k (the floor from which we drop the egg) increases, 
    * the break and not-break cases exhibit a predictable pattern that allows for a binary search approach.
    
    // Reasoning Behind Binary Search:
        * When we partition at floor k, we have two scenarios:
            * The egg breaks: This means we need to search below k, specifically k-1 floors with e-1 eggs.
            * The egg does not break: We can continue the search above k, which is f-k floors with e eggs.
        * This split leads to a "valley" pattern in the number of attempts:
            * When we start at lower values of k, the break case is likely to be larger.
            * As k increases, the not-break case tends to dominate.
        * Using binary search over the range of floors can help us converge more quickly to the optimal k where the worst-case attempt count is minimized. 
        * This approach reduces the time complexity from O(f^2) to O(f log f) for each egg-floor pair
