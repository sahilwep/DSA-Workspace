//  Minimum Subset Sum Difference:


// Problem Statement:
    * We are given an array of size n containing non-negative integers, 
    * the task is to divide it into two sets, s1, s2 such that the absolute difference b/w their sums is minimum, & find the minimum difference.


// Example:

    Input: N = 4, arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
    Output: 1
    Explanation: 
    Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
    Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11   

            abs(subset1:sum - subset2:sum) = 1


    Input: N = 2, arr[] = {1, 4}
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    Subset1 = {1}, sum of Subset1 = 1
    Subset2 = {4}, sum of Subset2 = 4


// Observations:
    * According to the question:

                         [array]
                        /      \
                {subset1}      {subset2} 
                    |               |
                    s1              s2

                    s1 = s2     =>      s1 - s2 = 0
                                        s1 - s2 = minimum

                abs(s1:sum - s2:sum) = minimum as possible

    * Example:
                arr[] = {1 6 11 5}

                    {1, 6}      {11, 5}
                      7           16
                        abs(16 - 7) = 9

                    {6, 5}      {11, 1}
                        abs(11 - 12) = 1 Minimum
                
            * So, we have to divide our array into two subset, such a way so that our subset sum difference will be as minimum possible.
        
                        [array]
                        /     \
                     [P1]     [P2]   -> partition
                      |        |
                      S1      S1    -> Sum, we need to find sum..


                      array =   {1, 6, 11, 5}
                                  /      \
                              {...}     {...}   -> From this array some number goes in first subset & rest goes in second subset..
                                S1        S2    -> From this we will get the sum of both the subset...
                            
                    
                    * We, don't know the exact value of S1, & S2, but we can predict the range of it..
                    * We can say:
                                S1 & S2 âˆˆ (0, n), n can be any number...


                    * Extreme value of subset: 

                            array: [ | | | ] 
                                    -> { }  Empty subset
                                    -> { ... } subset equal to an array itself

                            * If subset is empty, value will be 0.
                            * and if subset is equal to array itself, value will be n.
                            * We need to find the sum of both the subset, right..
                            * We can say the range of sub will lie from 0 to Array:Sum
                        
                            * Range:
                                                    |
                                0 |-----------------|-------------------| n

                                    array =   {1, 6, 11, 5}
                                    sum = 23

                                * For, a given range of subset sum, which one can be represent as our subset sum ?

                                                sum = 3 -> this can't be represent..
                                                sum = 4 -> this can't be represent..
                                                sum = 6 -> this can be represent..
                                                sum = 7 -> this can be represent..

                                        * So, not all the sum range can be represent as our subset sum..
                                        * Like s1, s2 value never be 3, 4..
                                        * So, we have to filter those value which are not suitable for our subset sum...
                                

                                * Another Example:

                                            arr[] = {1, 2, 7}   -> Sum = 10

                                            Range:
                                                s1/s2 {0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10} -> These are the possible candidate that can be subset sum of s1/s2.
                                
                                * Note: S1 & S2 =>  are single array, because when we combined them together:

                                                [array] -> Sum
                                                /    \
                                              [s1]  [s2]

                                    * Observe Carefully:

                                            .... We can say, for half range we find the other half range..

                                        * Because, s1 + s2 = sum of whole array..


                                    * Concluding on the point that, we only need to iterate till half, & we can find the s1.
                                    * When we got s1, then we can automatically find s2, because (s2 = range - s1)
                                    * We can Say, we don't need to find s1 & s2, we only need to find:
                                             
                                            s1 & (range - s1)

                                    * So, if we get only one subset, then we can find the other half, & then we can find the minimum subset difference..

                                    * So, We will have to find: abs(s2 - s1) & minimize
                                                
                                                    (S2 - s1)     -> minimum

                                                    ((range - s1) - s1) -> minimum

                                        * here only need to check for first half sum candidate range, & We can get s1.

                                    * Conclusion:
                                        * First we can get the sum range, by adding all the elements of an array..
                                        * Then From there we will choose valid candidate subset sum, that can be eligible to becoming s1 & s2..
                                        * Then, we only need to find the first half of subset sum candidate, & from there we can get the absolute minimum subset sum difference..


            * Coming back to the point:

                We are given an array: [ | | | | | | | ]

                * We will find the sum of it..

                * Then from sum, we can see the range: (0 -> sum)

                                         |
                    0 |----|----|--------|--------|--------| range
                           X    Y        |        Z

                * We only need to check whether there is any subset in our array which has sum 'X'.
                * Similarly, whether there are any subset in our array with sum Y, & Z...

                * Now, this Problem is same as Subset Sum Problem: We are whether there is any subset exist in our array with sum X or not?.


                * Example:
                            arr[] = {1, 2, 7}   -> Sum = 10

                            Range:

                    * If we observe carefully, on row 3:
                    * we are checking for sum candidate {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} -> Whether any subset exist or not?
                    * and we are iterating in sum & finding the subset values whether exist or not?
                    * The last row will give us the data about the subset for (sum = 0 -> 10) whether any subset exist or not?
            
            
        * Concluding on the point: 
            * First we need to find the subset Sum of whole array...
            * Then we can get the last row or dp..
            * Then we can iterate till half of that row, & find the credible candidate for s1.
            * Once we got the candidate: we can do abs(s2 - s2) => abs(range - 2*s1) => & find the minimum of it from every candidate...
