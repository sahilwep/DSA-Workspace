// 0 - 1 Knapsack Memoization (Top-Down):


// Steps to make our recursive code into memoization:
    * In Bottom-Up we'he created matrix, So memoization(top-down) is an alternative to that, which is easy to implement, & having same performance as Bottom-up
    * We just need to add few lines in our recursive solution, & it's memoized..
    * We will create same matrix that we used to make in Bottom-up.
    * First we have to create a matrix where we are going to store the values: let the matrix be 't'
        * How do we decide, what will be our matrix dimensions:
            * Some inputs in our recursive solutions are changing(decreasing in size), & some are not changing
            * At most of the place 'n' & 'w' is changing.
            * So, we will create a matrix of these two variable whose values are changing...
                
                matrix:  t[n+1][w+1]        -> we are Creating matrix of n+1, because if we take n, then we need to store till 'n-1'

        * Initialize all the values of matrix with '-1'
            
            memset(t, -1, sizeof(t))        -> we can use memset function to fill matrix with default values.

        * Whenever we are finding some values, we always look on matrix either the value is present there or not.
            * If the values is present return directly.
            * Else: If values are not present in the matrix(means there will be '-1' at the position).
                * We will find the value & store it in memo-array
            * NOTE: We will check the values in matrix before finding it.

    * So, In Conclusion, what chances should be done in recursive Solution: 
        * First create a global matrix, or we can create it static,
        * Dimension of matrix depends on the variable values from recursive solution.
        * Size of matrix depends on the constrains of the variable values according to the question that we have given.
            * Example Let's say constrains of n & W are given that, n <= 100 & W <= 1000, 
                * So we can create a static matrix:  t[102][1002]   -> two values just to take for safety.
        * Then we will memset this matrix from parent function -> memset(t, -1, sizeof(t))
        * In recursive solution, after base case, we will check if the value that we are looking for is already present or not.
            * if we have our value in matrix, then we return the value to parent call.
            * Else we will try to find that value.
                * The recursive calls that we are using, we just have to update with t[n][w] = knapsack(....) 
        * That's it, our recursive solutions now become the Dp solutions.
    
        * Alway try to write memoization solution, because Memoization & Bottom-up have sameÂ complexity.

// Minimal Drawback: 
    * Sometimes Bottom-up works better in comparision to memoization, vice versa..
    * The only drawback is size of function call stack is increased..
    * But most of the time it's works perfectly..
