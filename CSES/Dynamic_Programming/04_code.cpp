//  CSES: Coin Combinations I

//  Problem statement: 
    * Consider a money system consisting of n coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. 
    * Your task is to calculate the number of distinct ways you can produce a money sum x using the available coins.

    * For example, if the coins are {2,3,5} and the desired sum is 9, there are 8 ways:
        2+2+5
        2+5+2
        5+2+2
        3+3+3
        2+2+2+3
        2+2+3+2
        2+3+2+2
        3+2+2+2

    * Constrains: 
        1 <= n <= 100
        1 <= x <= 10^6
        1 <= coins[i] <= 10^6

    
// Problem Visualization: 
    -> We are allowed to choose any coins for infinite number of times -> Which makes this question of unbounded knapsack type.
    -> we are given sum 'x', which we have to make, & we have to find total number of ways for which we can makes our value.
    
    -> This question is very simillar to the previous question: "CSES: Minimizing Coins"
    -> In "CSES: Minimizing Coins", we were finding the subproblem that takes minimum coins, but here we need to count all the possible subproblem which will generate our ans.
    -> and that will become our answer:

    // DP State: 
            
                dp[k] = no of ways to get the sum k
    
    // DP transitions: 
                        n
                dp[k] = Î£ dp[k - c[i]]
                        i=1
    
    // Base case:
            
                dp[0] = 1, There's one way to make sum 0 (by choosing no coins).
    
    // Final Subproblem:

                final subproblem -> dp[x]
