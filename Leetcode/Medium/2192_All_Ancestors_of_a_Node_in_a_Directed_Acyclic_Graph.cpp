//  2192. All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph


//  Problem Statement: 
    -> You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive).
    -> You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [from[i], to[i]] denotes that there is a unidirectional edge from from[i] to to[i] in the graph.
    -> Return a list answer, where answer[i] is the list of ancestors of the ith node, sorted in ascending order.
    -> A node u is an ancestor of another node v if u can reach v via a set of edges.

// Example:
    Example 1:

        Input: n = 8, edgeList = [[0,3],[0,4],[1,3],[2,4],[2,7],[3,5],[3,6],[3,7],[4,6]]
        Output: [[],[],[],[0,1],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,2,3]]
        Explanation:
        The above diagram represents the input graph.
        - Nodes 0, 1, and 2 do not have any ancestors.
        - Node 3 has two ancestors 0 and 1.
        - Node 4 has two ancestors 0 and 2.
        - Node 5 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 3.
        - Node 6 has five ancestors 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
        - Node 7 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.

    Example 2:

        Input: n = 5, edgeList = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
        Output: [[],[0],[0,1],[0,1,2],[0,1,2,3]]
        Explanation:
        The above diagram represents the input graph.
        - Node 0 does not have any ancestor.
        - Node 1 has one ancestor 0.
        - Node 2 has two ancestors 0 and 1.
        - Node 3 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 2.
        - Node 4 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.


// Observations: 
    -> We are sure that Graph is DAG.
    -> If we observe the graph carefully, we need to return the ancestors of every nodes..
    -> If we reverse the edge direction of every node, then we can simply traverse & store all the path nodes as ancestors of nodes..


// BruteForce Approach:
    -> Basic & bruteforce solution that comes into our mind in first glance:
        -> Reverse all the edges of graph.
        -> For every node use any traversal algorithm & visit their adjacent nodes..
        -> During the visit any nodes which comes into the path store it as ancestors of that node.

    // Complexity: 
        -> TC: O(V * (V + E))
        -> SC: O(V)
            -> V = total number of Nodes that we have in our graph.



// TopoSort Approach: 
    -> We are sure about the graph that it's DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
    -> We can perform TopoSort to find the linearOrdering, which will give us the details of every node that comes after everyOther nodes.
    // Why TopoSort: 
        -> Given graph is DAG -> Sure about no-cycle
        -> Because TopoSort Will give us linear ordering of every Node, which will let us know order in which the nodes are coming, & this details will helps us know about ancestors of every node.
    // Approach:
        -> with topo-sort format, we will maintain set of vector to store ancestors of every nodes:
            -> We will use vector<unordered_set<int>> which will store the ancestors.
        -> When we are explore adjNode of every node:
            -> ancestors[adjNode].insert(node);    // push ancestors of adjNode as Node where it's coming from.
            -> Also make sure to store all the ancestors of that "node" as ancestors of adjNode, using another for loop.

    // Complexity: 
        -> TC: O(V * V*Log(V))
            -> Building adjacency list: O(V+E) (as we iterate over edges)
            -> Computing in-degree: O(V+E) (since we traverse adjacency list)
            -> Topological Sort (BFS): O(V+E) (each node and edge is processed once)
            -> Processing ancestors: 
                -> Worst case, inserting and copying ancestors across nodes can take up to O(V^2) in dense graphs.
                -> Sorting ancestor lists takes O(V*log(V)) per node â†’ total O(V * (V * log(V)))

        -> SC: O(V^2), In worse case Storing ancestors will store all "V - 1" nodes.
            -> Example: 
                adj[] = {{}, {0}, {0, 1}, {0, 1, 2}, {0, 1, 2, 3}, {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}}
                -> This type of graph will take near to to n^2 space.
