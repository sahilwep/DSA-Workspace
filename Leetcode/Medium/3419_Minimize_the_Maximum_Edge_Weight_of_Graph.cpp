//  3419. Minimize the Maximum Edge Weight of Graph


//  Problem Statement: 
    -> You are given two integers, n and threshold, as well as a directed weighted graph of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. 
    -> The graph is represented by a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [Ai, Bi, Wi] indicates that there is an edge going from node Ai to node Bi with weight Wi.
    -> You have to remove some edges from this graph (possibly none), so that it satisfies the following conditions:
        -> Node 0 must be reachable from all other nodes.
        -> The maximum edge weight in the resulting graph is minimized.
        -> Each node has at most threshold outgoing edges.
    -> Return the minimum possible value of the maximum edge weight after removing the necessary edges. If it is impossible for all conditions to be satisfied, return -1.

    
    
// Example: 
    Example 1:
        Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,0,1],[2,0,2],[3,0,1],[4,3,1],[2,1,1]], threshold = 2
        Output: 1
        Explanation: Remove the edge 2 -> 0. The maximum weight among the remaining edges is 1.

    Example 2:
        Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[0,2,2],[0,3,1],[0,4,1],[1,2,1],[1,4,1]], threshold = 1
        Output: -1
        Explanation: It is impossible to reach node 0 from node 2.

    Example 3:
        Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2,1],[1,3,3],[1,4,5],[2,3,2],[3,4,2],[4,0,1]], threshold = 1
        Output: 2
        Explanation: Remove the edges 1 -> 3 and 1 -> 4. The maximum weight among the remaining edges is 2.

    Example 4:
        Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2,1],[1,3,3],[1,4,5],[2,3,2],[4,0,1]], threshold = 1
        Output: -1



// Observations: 

    -> We are given a directed graph with weighted edges. The goal is to remove some edges such that:
        -> Each node has at most 'threshold' outgoing edges.
        -> Every node can still reach node '0' (i.e., node 0 must be reachable from all other nodes).
        -> Among the remaining edges, the maximum edge weight used in this setup should be minimized.

        // Key Observations:
            1. Node '0' should be reachable from all nodes. So, we invert the edges and ensure a path from every node to 0.
            2. The edge removals must ensure:
                - The reachability condition.
                - No node has more than 'threshold' outgoing edges.
            3. We are minimizing the **maximum edge weight** used in the final valid configuration.
            4. Prim's-like approach is attempted here with a greedy selection of lowest weight edges while satisfying out-degree constraints.

    // MST Prim's Approach:
        -> We construct an inverted graph, since the problem wants all nodes to "reach" node 0.
        -> We use a "Prim's-algorithm-like greedy approach" to select low-weight edges that help cover all nodes while obeying the degree constraint.
        -> We use a priority queue (min-heap) to always pick the lowest-weight available edge.
        -> We track how many edges are selected from each node (via `deg`) to ensure we never exceed the threshold.
        -> The variable `ans` keeps track of the **maximum weight** among the chosen edges â€” we want to minimize this.


// Complexity:
    -> TC: O(m * log m)
        -> Total pushes into the heap: O(m)
        -> Each heap operation: O(log m))
    -> SC: O(n + m)
        -> N = total nodes
