//  1627. Graph Connectivity With Threshold

//  Problem Statement: 
    -> We have n cities labeled from 1 to n. Two different cities with labels x and y are directly connected by a bidirectional road if and only if x and y share a common divisor strictly greater than some threshold. 
    -> More formally, cities with labels x and y have a road between them if there exists an integer z such that all of the following are true:
        -> x % z == 0,
        -> y % z == 0, and
        -> z > threshold.
    -> Given the two integers, n and threshold, and an array of queries, you must determine for each queries[i] = [ai, bi] if cities ai and bi are connected directly or indirectly. (i.e. there is some path between them).
    -> Return an array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is true if for the ith query, there is a path between ai and bi, or answer[i] is false if there is no path.

 
// Example: 

    Example 1:

                    [1]     [2]     [3]
                                     |
                                     |
                    [4]     [5]     [6]

        Input: n = 6, threshold = 2, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
        Output: [false,false,true]
        Explanation: 
            The divisors for each number:
                1:   1
                2:   1, 2
                3:   1, 3
                4:   1, 2, 4
                5:   1, 5
                6:   1, 2, 3, 6
            Using the underlined divisors above the threshold, only cities 3 and 6 share a common divisor, so they are the only ones directly connected. 
            The result of each query:
                [1,4]   1 is not connected to 4
                [2,5]   2 is not connected to 5
                [3,6]   3 is connected to 6 through path 3--6


        Example 2:

                    {Complete Graph Formations}

            Input: n = 6, threshold = 0, queries = [[4,5],[3,4],[3,2],[2,6],[1,3]]
            Output: [true,true,true,true,true]
                Explanation: The divisors for each number are the same as the previous example. However, since the threshold is 0,
                all divisors can be used. Since all numbers share 1 as a divisor, all cities are connected.

        Example 3:
                        [1]             [2]
                                         |
                        [3]             [4]
                                [5]

            Input: n = 5, threshold = 1, queries = [[4,5],[4,5],[3,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
            Output: [false,false,false,false,false]
                Explanation: Only cities 2 and 4 share a common divisor 2 which is strictly greater than the threshold 1, so they are the only ones directly connected.
                Please notice that there can be multiple queries for the same pair of nodes [x, y], and that the query [x, y] is equivalent to the query [y, x].


// DSU Solution:
    -> From the given graph, we have multiple query which we have to check wether the graph is connected is not?
    -> If graph is connected only by following the valid given constrains, then return ans[i] = true : else false
    -> DSU will help us to join the components & check efficiently wether given two nodes are connected or not, by following valid given constrins..

    // Find common Divisor from both the nodes (u, v), & should be greater than the given threshold point.

        [Way 1]:
            -> Write custom function to check the common divisor from both the number..
                bool isDivisorGrater(int u, int v, int thr) {   // find all the divisor
                    // For U:
                    unordered_set<int> st;  // set will help us to know about the common divisor from both the nodes
                    for(int i = thr + 1; i <= u; i++) { // start from threshold point, insted of starting at '1'
                        if(u % i == 0) {    // We are starting after threshold point, so we only need to check divisibility with nodes
                            st.insert(i);   // store all the divisor of u, that are above than the threshold points.
                        }
                    }
                    // Same for V:
                    for(int i = thr + 1; i <= v; i++) {
                        if(v % i == 0) {
                            if(st.count(i)) {   // find for common divisor
                                return true;    // found, return true.
                            }
                        }   
                    }

                    return false;   // not greater.
                }

            -> From the above function, we can find the common divisor for both the nodes, & check wether it should be greater than threshold or not?

        [Way 2]:
            -> If we observe carefully, in mathematical term, GCD(u, v) => Greatest common divisor
            -> GCD: 
                -> This will us greatest common divisor from both the number,
                -> IF GCD Value is greater than the threshold point => we can connect these two nodes.
                -> In simple,       if(GCD(u, b) > threshold) -> Connect that.


    // Instead of checking GCD for all (i, j) pairs which is expensive, we realize that:
        -> For any integer `i > threshold`, all multiples of `i` will have GCD â‰¥ i > threshold with `i`.
        -> Thus, we can iterate through each `i` from (threshold + 1) to n and union it with its multiples.
        -> This results in efficient component building using Disjoint Set Union (DSU).

    -> Now coming back, we only need to connect the component first & then we can check the query...
