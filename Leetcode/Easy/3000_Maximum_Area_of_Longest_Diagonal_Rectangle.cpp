//  3000. Maximum Area of Longest Diagonal Rectangle


//  Problem Statement: 
    -> You are given a 2D 0-indexed integer array dimensions.
    -> For all indices i, 0 <= i < dimensions.length, dimensions[i][0] represents the length and dimensions[i][1] represents the width of the rectangle i.
    -> Return the area of the rectangle having the longest diagonal. If there are multiple rectangles with the longest diagonal, return the area of the rectangle having the maximum area.

 
// Example:
    Example 1:
        Input: dimensions = [[9,3],[8,6]]
        Output: 48
        Explanation: 
        For index = 0, length = 9 and width = 3. Diagonal length = sqrt(9 * 9 + 3 * 3) = sqrt(90) â‰ˆ 9.487.
        For index = 1, length = 8 and width = 6. Diagonal length = sqrt(8 * 8 + 6 * 6) = sqrt(100) = 10.
        So, the rectangle at index 1 has a greater diagonal length therefore we return area = 8 * 6 = 48.

    Example 2:
        Input: dimensions = [[3,4],[4,3]]
        Output: 12
        Explanation: Length of diagonal is the same for both which is 5, so maximum area = 12.

 
// Observations: 
    -> We are given 2D indexed integer array dimensions.
    -> We need to compute the area of rectangle having the largest diagonal.
    -> If there are multiple rectangle with longest diagonal return the area of rectangle having maximum area.
    
    // Approach:
        -> Diagonal Formula: sqrt(l^2 + b^2)
            -> We will compute diagonalSquare, not diagonal, because comparing with squareroot we will introduce floating number, which will interfere with our answer.
        -> Compute the diagonal square: l * l + b * b
        -> Compute the square of rectangle: l * b
        -> Compare with previous diagonalSquare with previous stored, get the best one
        -> If multiple diagonalSquare are same, get the largest area rectangle.

        // Complexity:
            -> TC: O(n)
            -> SC: O(1)
                -> n = dimensions.size()

        // Extra:
            -> If we want to compare diagonal insted of diagonalSquare, we have to use double Type for precision.
