// Quadratic Equations Roots : 


// Examples : 

Input:
a = 1
b = -2
c = 1
Output: 1 1
Explanation:
Roots of equation x2-2x+1 are 1 and 1.

Input:
a = 1
b = -7
c = 12
Output: 4 3
Explanation: Roots of equation 
x2 - 7x + 12 are 4 and 3.

// Observations : 
    * We can solve this by using the general formula for finding the roots of quadratic equations.
