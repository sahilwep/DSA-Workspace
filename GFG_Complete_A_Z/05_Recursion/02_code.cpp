/*
// Applications of Recursion: 

* Many algorithms technique are based on Recursion: 
    * Dynamic Programming: In dynamic programming, first step is to write recursive solution & We see overlapping some problems in it.
    * Backtracking: backtracking solutions are inheritably recursive in nature..
    * Divide & Conquer(Binary search, Quick sort, & merge sort)

* Many problem are recursive in nature: 
    * Tower of hanoi
    * DFS Based traversal: 
        * Inorder traversal
        * Preorder traversal
        * Postorder traversal

* Also there are many other use case of Recursion..
