# array Questions : 


## Questions : 
1. find the largest element in an array.    : with Sorting, with assumption of first element be the largest and iterate from 1 to n.
2. find the smallest element in an array. : with sorting, with assumption of first element be the smallest and iterate from 1 to n.
3. find the second largest element in an array : brute, better, optimal (**Must visit**)
4. find the second smallest element in an array : brute, better, optimal (must visit)
5. find that array is sorted or not ?   : (visit)
6. remove the duplicate the from an array : (MUST VISIT) using set, & two pointer
7. Left rotate array by one place : store the first element in temp, then use a[i-1]=a[i], after place a[n-1]=temp
8. Left rotate array by D place : Must visit (Optimal solution : using reversing the certain range... )
9. Move all zeroes to the end of the array.     : Must visit (optimal solution 2 pointer, where one pointer is at 0 & second at non-zero & swapping whenever it found non-zero.)

* Given an array, find the largest and smallest elements using a single traversal.
* Rotate an array to the left by a given number of steps.
* Reverse an array using recursion.
* Find the second most frequent element in an array.
* Check if an array is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
* Find the product of all elements in the array.
* Remove duplicates from an unsorted array without using extra space.
* Find the longest subarray with equal 0s and 1s in a binary array.
* Merge two sorted arrays in-place, without using extra space.

### Level 2 (Moderate):

* Find the largest subarray with equal number of 0s, 1s, and 2s.
* Given an array, rearrange the elements in a way such that the maximum and minimum elements appear at alternate positions.

### Level 4 (Challenging):
